# go-reverse-shell
### A reverse shell written in Go. Bypass AV with FUD.


## Usage

Edit the `util.go` file, to match your preferences

`$ make all`

`$ nc -lnvp <port>`



## Future Plans

[X] create client executables

[ ] create a make file that builds across platforms

[ ] create a docker container that can build and obfuscate code



### Part of a larger plan, to create a fully-fledged C&C Server
